    "Take into account that in the initialization of the `Alignment` objects you can set whichever molecule you want as end resolution. This opens the door to use gaddlemaps to change molecules in your system. For example change a membrane of POPC with one of PCCP keeping the configuration of the initial molecules. Now we need to align molecules in both resolution to finally obtain the exchange maps. This can be done with the initialized objects. However, before starting the alignment we should think about passing constrains to the algorithm. Lets discuss the constrains for each molecule type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DNA fragment: As we said before, this can be considered as a protein as it is a molecule with multiple residues. When this is the case, the Alignment will automatically optimize the process assigning constrains for all the atoms using the residue sequence through the `guess_protein_restrains` function. So generally, we do not have to worry about this kind of big molecules. NOTE: If we now that the residue sequence in both resolution do not match we should set the `auto_guess_protein_restrictions` argument to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DPSM: This molecule can be very tricky to map as it is formed by three ramifications. One of them is a polar head and the others are organic tails of different lengths. As the algorithm does not use atom types to identify restrains we should pass our own clues about which atoms match some beads. For this molecule two or three restrains indicating the terminal atoms correspondence of each branch should be more than enough. We can select this restrains using the graphical interface that the `interactive_restrictions` method brings us or, if we already now the atoms index in both resolution we can just set the restrictions to a list. For example: \n",

    "restrictions = [(0, 44), (8, 34), (5, 0)]\n",

    "Once the restrictions are chosen we can initialize the alignment process. However, before continuing, lets see some of the functionalities that the alignment process offers through its arguments:\n",

    "- `deformation_types`: The algorithm will randomly change the position of the molecules to find the optimum alignment. These changes in each step are also randomly chosen by default between three types of changes: translations, rotations and atomic deformations (see the article for a better explanation). With this argument we can change these types of changes for example to only perform translations and rotations. This argument can be very handy when we know that the molecules in the initial and final resolutions are in the same configuration. In this case, setting this argument to (0, 1), we can avoid to perform atomic deformations which is the most computational time demanded change.\n",
    "- `ignore_hydrogens`: If True (which is the default), the hydrogen atoms will be ignored in the distances calculations. This results in better performance.\n",
    "- `auto_guess_protein_restrictions`: If True (default) and `restrictions` is None, the restrains will be automatically set if the molecule has more than one residue using the residue sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these considerations we can now align our molecules. This step can take a while depending on the molecules you want to align and specially on the backend implementation you are using. For example: the DPSM molecule will take less than 1 second with the c++ implementation and around 20 seconds using the python one. However, this difference is larger when large molecules are considered, e.g. for the DNA molecule the process takes around 2 minutes with the c++ backend and around 1 hour with the other. This means that if you are mapping systems with small molecules you can avoid the c++ backend installation. However, if you are planning to map large molecules like proteins you should spend some time in the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 1**: If you are using the c++ extension for the backend (which is highly recommended) you will not see any output during the process in the cell. The output will be displayed in the terminal where the jupyter-notebook is running. We are working on fixing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 2**: You can avoid the alignment process if you initialize the `Alignment` object with molecular configurations that have been already aligned before, e.g. you have already aligned the molecules for mapping other systems."
